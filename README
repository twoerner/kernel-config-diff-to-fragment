kernel-config-diff-to-fragment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The kconfig system is able to work with kconfig fragments. A kconfig
fragment is a file that contains a subset of a full kconfig file. A set of
fragments can be merged with a base defconfig to produce a full kconfig.
Fragments are usefull for adding or removing isolated functionality.

Generating a fragment is usually done by hand, this tool helps to automate
the process.

Start with a current configuration, say in .config, save this to
'beforeconfig'. Then run 'make menuconfig', tweak the configuration however
you wish. When you're done save the resulting new config to 'afterconfig'.

Generate a unified diff of the two configurations:
	$ diff -u beforeconfig afterconfig > frag.diff

Run 'frag.diff' through this tool to produce a kconfig fragment:
	$ kernel-config-to-fragment frag.diff > frag.cfg
